# CS32 - UCLA, Spring Quarter 2023
This Repository contains my homework/lab solutions for UCLA Fall 2023 CS33 (Computer Organization) with Professor Glenn Reinmann. In this course, I learned a variety of topics relating to computer organization, including integer encodings, x86 Assembly, Floating Point, Program Optimization, Memory Hierarchy, OPENMP, ECF and Linking, Virtual Memory, and MIPS. This course consisted of 6 Homework Assignments and 4 Lab Assignments, with the Bomb Lab being my favorite.
